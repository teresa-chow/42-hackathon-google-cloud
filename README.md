## Description

RITA – Robô Inteligente de Triagem Automatizada [Smart Robot for Automated Triage] is a smart triage agent based on the Manchester Triage System that is able to take natural language input (text or voice) and classify the priority of patient treatment, based on the described symptoms.

Designed to streamline the triage process in healthcare settings, this project was developed during a hackathon to address the pressing issue of long wait times and overcrowding in emergency services. By combining AI with clinical expertise, RITA provides an efficient triage process, reducing the workload of healthcare professionals.
